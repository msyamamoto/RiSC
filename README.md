# RiSC - Riemannian Spectral Clustering -
This repository hosts Matlab code for outlier detection RiSC (odenRiSC) and multimodal classifier RiSC (mcRiSC), which are proposed in [1].

#### Toolboxes we use
Note that to use odenRiSC/mcRiSC, you need the Matlab Riemannian geometry toolbox by Alexandre Barachant, available here:

## News (As of July 2023)
Currently, only function codes are available. A script to run the example experiment will be uploaded with the public dataset soon.
